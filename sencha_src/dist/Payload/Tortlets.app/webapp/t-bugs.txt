Dr save should only happen in case data changed (partial done)

 add back button to registrationPage1 as well
  -- Back button on registration page, should go to origin. (If from guage screen, go to guage, if from snapsignupdone form go back to that form)



Row was updated by another transaction : This happens many times in real app while dr , tse update. 
org.hibernate.StaleObjectStateException: Row was updated or deleted by another transaction (or unsaved-value mapping was incorrect): [com.softrism.tortlets.domain.Dream#26]; nested exception is javax.persistence.OptimisticLockException:

This exception should be handled


Try alert mechanism "App is updated, do you want to update"
