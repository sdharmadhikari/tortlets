Again, create blank project,
Disable build tools
Save configuration.
Save project.
Go to project directory and List of things generated and list here.
	- app directory
	- app.js
	- index.html
	- metadata directory
	- project.xds directory.
	
Copy from original location from the list.
Mv index.html to org-index.html
Open the project in 3.0
Open first configuration and set build-tools to disabled.
Save it. It should create index. Now customize this index using the-IDE and try to make same as org-index.html.
Now from architect see if there is any trace of old ST version. Library version etc.
Now enable build-tools from the-IDE
If not enabled (mostly it will not), Go to Sencha SDK directory and run
/Users/sudhir/bin/Sencha/Cmd/4.0.1.45/sencha generate app --refresh=false MyApp /Users/sudhir/Projects/trials/dnoram-edited/
If you run sencha app build -run native . It might fail by NullPointer exception because above command did not generate/touch your old index.html.
Or you saved project from architect again and overwriting index.html which was backup in metadata of architect.
SO
Go to architect and click do not overwrite index.html
Now copy the index.html as is from your blank project (it has development.js etc) 
Change project name to appropriate. 
Run command "pathtosencha/sencha app build -run native.
It should kickoff the emulator !!!
