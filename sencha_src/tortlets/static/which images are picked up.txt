My images confusion

All images with ipad word in it are there, but all with sencha leaf.
icons are being picked from resource/icons directory
splash screens are being picked up from resources/loading directory
resource/startup directory is being ignored.
files in static/images are used by webapp (not by native shell)
static/trial_images is dump of all images including inkscape files
