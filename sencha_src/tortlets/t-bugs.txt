t-bugs sequence

tse -> back -> dr -> back click on other dr, shows previous dr 


Sample dream auto-creation ? 
Click on different dr , sometimes show previous click tses
https ! 
Dr save should only happen in case data changed (partial done)
For every entity except tuser, userid column should be treated as id (hibernateid) not userid (userid can change !) 
  -- Might have server side aspects changes too ( need to get id instead of userid from SEcurityContext)
  -- Dr save userid=id
  -- Tse save userid=id
 add back button to registrationPage1 as well
  -- Back button on registration page, should go to origin. (If from guage screen, go to guage, if from snapsignupdone form go back to that form)



Row was updated by another transaction : This happens many times in real app while dr , tse update. 
org.hibernate.StaleObjectStateException: Row was updated or deleted by another transaction (or unsaved-value mapping was incorrect): [com.softrism.tortlets.domain.Dream#26]; nested exception is javax.persistence.OptimisticLockException: 
This happens when you update data from another client !
This exception should be handled


Try alert mechanism "App is updated, do you want to update"
