tortlets got mixed up with other dr (check for day 09/22/13, scratch programming got into maintain health.)
If dream lenght is longer, next page shows bad title.(can i use ellipse)
layout problem of home tab.
Today or Pending tabs must be refreshed when app pops up.
Try several times sign in with other users, sometimes shows server error.

Has to be Back button when snap sign on is selected.
Tse score not yet implemented (with tse images)
Not using ellipse anywhere to cut the longer sentence

When new user is genearated after sign out, pie chart shows same data.
Does Tuser save has failure handling ?
When dream tab is selected, and server down, it does not show error.
When Your score tab is shown, it does not show, server error.
Back to dreams now scrolls in direction "up", i think that is only in one condition, either old or new dream.
Try alert mechanism "App is updated, do you want to update"
