Importing and re-importing modules into current project.

1. REmoving is better than adding something in imported module when customizing the component.
2. When u reimport, delete original imported component, then re-import.
3. But app.js has entry of old component(for example loginmodule) in views section. Delete and readd component in views list.
4. If you were using component in card-panel and the item was at 0th position, remember that active-item is now set to 1 not to 0. Because you removed that component.
5. Whenver you customize the component, remember to always add application wide event. Easy to replace component and also, easy to make your customization as standard.
6. You may have to re-add event listeners, if you have to dont forget function parameters.
